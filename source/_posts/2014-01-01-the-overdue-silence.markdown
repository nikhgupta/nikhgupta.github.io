I know. I know. New year, sometimes, have such an effect on individuals, and
I am no different. I am a person who appreciates art, and the new year just
happens to bring so much of it. So, let me first wish a new year to you and to
me, with a wish that this year will give us the ever-elusive satisfaction every
one wants in their life, that this year will bring us closer to our dreams - the
precious!

The Apology
-----------

Via this blog post, I wanted to put an excuse to my blog for not being able to
post for the last two months, and I am still wondering on one. All I can say is
that:

> We, the mere humans, are lazy.  
> We, the mere humans, can never stick to our promises, no matter how special.

To be honest, I got involved with a ruby gem that tried to convert text markup
from one language to another, e.g. from [Markdown](markdown) to
[Textile](textile) markup, or maybe from [Org Mode](org-mode) to
[Markdown](markdown), and so on. Oh, and not only that, I was in the process of
picking up a partner for a few startups I had in my mind, and was building up on
them.

Later, when I was about missing my newly-refreshed blog, things in my
personal life took some turn - my dad suffered from heart strokes - two of them
- in a matter of days. Life sucks for such things.

Moreover, I am really fighting with myself to put an end to my 9-5 job. I have
been wanting to end it since an year, now, and finally, I have decided to do
this. Yeah, I went over this decision, slept over it and what not. A 9-5
government job that has no relation to what I love, what I am passionate about
simply does not make any sense to me or to anyone who knows my affair with
programming and computers, anymore.

Having settled the reasons, all I can say is that I plan on posting regularly,
though I won't make a promise, but I will post when possible.

Resolutions
-----------

I hate resolutions. They bind me for the things I do not want to do. Now, you
would ask:

> **Why only things that you do not want to do?**
> > *Because, if I really wanted to do something, I won't wait for the new year to
> > happen.*
 
> **Alright, but even then, resolutions are good, right?**
> > *No! They are evil. They tell me to do something against my freewill. And,
> > hence, I already know, I won't listen to them after sometime, anyways.*
 
> **Okay, so you don't plan on changing yourself, for the good?**
> > Who said, I don't want to do that. You must first tell me what's wrong with
> > me, for this conversation to work out.

The First Month
---------------

Oh, yes, I have a few simple plans for this month, which include:

- posting a timeline of the major events from my life on this blog.
- start work on one of the startup ideas I had in my mind.
- resign from my 9-5 job and leave the government to work on its own.
- pack up and go live in a place with a better climate by the end of the month.
- photography visits nearly every week

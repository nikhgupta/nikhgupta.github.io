Hey all,

I do have this habit of clicking random pictures whenever I am with my
Sony-DSC-HX1, out in the woods. I am, gradually, progressing on creating
Flickr Photosets with all these random clicks organized into categories.

The Photoset below is directly being rendered via Flickr, and contain one such
category - The Trees and The Leaves.

Let me know, if you like the captures :)

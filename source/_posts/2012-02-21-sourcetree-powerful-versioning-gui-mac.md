Recently, while looking at some of my private repositories over at BitBucket,
I came across [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) which seems to be
a really powerful Git GUI for Mac OSX (also supports Mercurial, and
Subversion).  Though, honestly, I always prefer the command line version for
the centralized access from the Shell, but often I need to see the commit
history, file diffs, want to select part of the current working tree to commit
and other such things and SourceTree happens to solve these things for me, in
a nice-to-look GUI application. Presently, SourceTree is free but its going
to be a paid application.

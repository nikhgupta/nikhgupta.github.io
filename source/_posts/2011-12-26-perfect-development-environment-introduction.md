Alright, so I recently installed Ubuntu Oneiric on my local workstation, and as it happens in these times, I started looking to setup my perfect Development Environment on Ubuntu. This is going to be a series of posts on this topic, and will include step-wise bash commands to install specific pieces (I hate writing a lot, and hence, even if I really wanted this series to be a tutorial, it should only be seen as my notes on this quest)

OK. So, first things first.. <strong>What comprises this Environment?</strong> Well, there are a lot of things I learnt all this time, and have been listed below:

  <li><strong><a title="Perfect Development Environment :: Common Web Pre-requisites" href="http://nikhgupta.com/code/development-server/perfect-development-environment-common-web-pre-requisites/" target="_blank">Common Web Pre-requisites</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a title="Perfect Development Environment :: Basic Web Commons" href="http://nikhgupta.com/code/development-environment/perfect-development-environment-basic-web-commons/" target="_blank">Basic Web Commons</a></strong> (git, subversion, curl, wget, guake, openssl, openssh, etc)</li>
  <li><strong><a title="Perfect Development Environment :: Dot Files" href="http://nikhgupta.com/code/development-environment/perfect-development-environment-dot-files/" target="_blank">Dot Files</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a title="Perfect Development Environment :: DNSMasq" href="http://nikhgupta.com/code/development-environment/perfect-development-environment-dnsmasq/" target="_blank">DNSMasq</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a title="Perfect Development Environment :: LAMP Stack" href="http://nikhgupta.com/code/development-environment/perfect-development-environment-lamp-stack/" target="_blank">LAMP Stack</a></strong> (absolutely essential - apache + mysql + php5 + phpmyadmin)</li>
  <li><strong>Ruby Stack</strong> (absolutely fascinating - single_user_rvm + nginx + rubies + rails + unicorn + passenger + thin + mongrol)</li>
  <li><strong>Automating Regularly Used Tasks</strong></li>
  <li>Setting Up <strong>WordPress</strong> (LAMP Stack), and <strong>Redmine</strong> (Rails Stack)</li>
</ol>

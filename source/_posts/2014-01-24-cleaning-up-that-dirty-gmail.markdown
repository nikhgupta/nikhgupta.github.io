I am really frustrated seeing all that clutter in my gmail account. I can not
look through that mess and find mails that interest me or search for an old one.
To worsen up the matter, a client asked me to forward an old mail and I have to
really scroll down through a long list of mails to find the one that I wanted.

So, I thought why not kill some time cleaning up my emails, and set them up
perfectly to get rid of this issue once and for all, and meanwhile, why not blog
about the process at the same time.

<!-- more -->

So, stay tuned while I clean up my email, setup a really nice and clean app on
my Macbook and let you know what I found. Oh, and maybe, I will just migrate
from GMail at the same time, since I have really gone bored with its look, now.
A friend of mine uses Live and I really liked the crisp UI it provides. We will
see if that is something I like or not.

## Live.com - Like it or not?

- **Step 1**: Create an account: `nikhgupta@live.com`. And, to be honest, I am
  really glad that I could find my username as available on live. I am a happy
  panda.

- **Step 2**: Add aliases for your account. I really liked this feature, where
  I can register multiple emails for myself and use the same password to access
  all of them. So, I registered: `nikhgupta@live.in`, `nick.devel@live.in` and
  `mestoic@live.in`. I wanted to use `nick.devel@live.in` exclusively for work
  related emails, and therefore, setup a mail rule to sort all emails to this
  address to a `Work` folder. Oh, and just for the log, in order to do that
  I needed to verify my Live.com account.

- **Step 3**: I configured several different options for the new account, and by
  now, I was sure that I wanted to give Live.com a real try. I could always
  switch back to my GMail account later, if needed.

- **Step 4**: I deleted all the labels and filters from my GMail account before
  I was to import all its mails to Live. I did not have a lot such labels or
  filters, so it did not pain me much to do this.

- **Step 5**: I imported my Gmail account to Live, using Live's importer.

- **Step 6**: Finally, I added forwarding from Gmail account to my Live account.

## Searching for that perfect mail app

- **Step 1**: `.mail`.. yeah! I looked at that app sometime back and really
  loved it, so let's check if it has launched yet or not. Results: Nope.

- **Step 2**: Nothin'. I will use the awesome `Mail` app that comes with Macs.
  Actually, I have searched for a perfect mail client some time back but could
  not find a decent one, and at that time, I promised myself to setup the
  default mail client, someday. So, here, we go.

Entangled and consumed, I stand at my door.
For there is no one left whom I adore..
Worried. Pacing fast, I look in the mirror,
Uncontrolled, Unrecognized. Have I grown gaffer?

Given up everything that I was born with,
everything around me, now, stands as a myth..
that lady, that pride, that rain and that smile,
Years have passed. My life is part of an exile..

Left so much in the past, things remain unfinished,
my dreams blemished and my conscience anguished..
The attitude, now, reflects a success with money,
No one's aware. Have I lost my genie?

Wasted. Shooting towards a devouring prophecy,
I watch her smilin', turnin in a pixie..
Scared. Amidst everything forlorn for now,
I have, yet, to learn to live nohow..

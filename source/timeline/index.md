This page highlights various spheres of my life in a visual timeline format.
Normally, I would love to tell a story or two, but I am inspired by anything 
that represents information in a nice, concise, and elegant manner.

Trust me, you will love these timelines:

  - **[Overview](/timeline/life.html)**
  - **[Important Events](/timeline/important_events.html)**

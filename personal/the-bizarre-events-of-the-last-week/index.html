I had a road accident few days back &ndash; broke my jaw, amd my mouth is now
completely sealed with wires running horizontally and vertically across it,
and realized some pretty awesome things during my treatment. Wont be able to
speak for around a month, and would only be back to work in around 2-3 days,
properly. Fortunately, no other part of the body except my jaw was de-arranged
:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Normally, such a post would make into my diary, but considering the interest
generated by my friends and my clients, I preferred to write it all down here.
This post is supposed to provide an overview of the chronological order of the
incidents, and if the God was really bluffing with me that day :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a Thursday evening, and having spent the entire day deducing the perfect
User Interface for some end-users and bringing it to the surface, I surely
deserved a few rounds. I went to a lounge named 100% Rock (or, TC &ndash; which,
I heavily despise for the fact that most of their crowd is comprised of high
school students). My best friend wanted a confirmation about her current choice
of a boyfriend, and I am sure she finds me a better judge of human personality
:)</p>

<p>After a few drinks and endless talks, the company parted and I reached over to
my bike. I gave her one more look, and found her stunningly gorgeous. I only
love two non-living things in my life &ndash; my macbook, and my bike. I started my
bike and enjoyed the cool breeze in the summer nights. It must be midnight.
Somehow, I wanted to call up a close friend and discuss something. I called up,
and told that I will be at his place in half an hour, and hanged up the phone.
As soon as I did, I had already crashed into an animal that crossed the road
from nowhere. It was dark black. That animal was black. I could only make out
that the road had no lights, and there was possibly no way to reach me by simply
stating the directions to someone on phone.</p>

<p>I was bleeding profusely from my mouth. It seemed that my jaw had been
dislocated and I could barely breathe. I had to call someone to get me to
nearest first-aid, but the road was empty and the road was dark. Oh, wow.. We do
not have a 911 emergency number in India. So, somehow, I called up at my house
(which was fortunately nearby), and asked them to come pick me up. Since, I knew
it would be harder for them to find me since I could not give them a pin point
direction, I rode my bike again, and parked it at a place where they can spot
me. That place was around 3 KMs from the initial accident location, and I am not
sure how I made through these 3 KMs, probably foolish, but saved atleast 15
minutes of time which would have been wasted finding my exact location earlier.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was admitted in Emergency and they stitched me up, and asked me to
visit a Plastic Surgeon in the morning. I felt there was no big deal, as the
pain killers have started to kick in by this time, and I could easily speak and
all. I felt it was a normal accident.</p>

<p>So, the next day I went to this doctor, and made him see some of the scans, etc.
and expected him to say something like its a normal thing and that I was okay.
Instead, he said, &ldquo;Your jaw has been fractured. We need to insert metal supports
and probably, wire up your mouth for a month long&rdquo;. That last line killed me.
I don&rsquo;t care if they need to insert metal supports or if my jaw was fractured.
I hate those wire braces, and more than I hate not speaking. I can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t-speak
for more than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was admitted for the above, and I asked the doctors to put me in
a public ward instead of a private one. The reason seemed obvious to me. I knew
the injury was quite too much for me, but I also knew it was not a really big
deal, which was confirmed once I had been shifted to a public ward. I saw a guy
with his legs joined to each other with metal support and what not. For the
first time in my life, hospitals did not make me sick, that environment did not
make me leave it, but instead I could find the courage I lacked in the
sufferrings of the persons lying around me. All I had to think was probably,
I was saved, or probably, God was being funnier. He left you to do anything and
everything else you want, just prohibited you from speaking for some unknown
reasons.</p>

<p>Well, they first sealed my mouth as they said &ndash; horizontally and vertically.
I could not make a movement inside my mouth. And, then, they operated me and
inserted some small metal plates for support. I could not feel those plates,
cannot feel them still, but I could feel those wires around my mouth, and I was
immediately reminded of the Tom Hardy character (Bane) from the Dark Knight
rises &ndash; the only difference being the metal is all inside my mouth :)</p>

<p>Anyways, I am back home, and I am still pondering on how to best spend this next
one month, but I am sure things could have gone a lot worse than that, but
I have been saved.</p>
